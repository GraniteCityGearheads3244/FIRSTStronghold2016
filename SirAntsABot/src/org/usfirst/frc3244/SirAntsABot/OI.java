    //// CREATING BUTTONS
    // One type of button is a joystick button which is any button on a joystick.
    // You create one by telling it which joystick it's on and which button
    // number it is.
    // Joystick stick = new Joystick(port);
    // Button button = new JoystickButton(stick, buttonNumber);

    // There are a few additional built in buttons you can use. Additionally,
    // by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
    // commands the same as any other Button.

    //// TRIGGERING COMMANDS WITH BUTTONS
    // Once you have a button, it's trivial to bind it to a button in one of
    // three ways:

    // Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
    // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
    // button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());

    // Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
    // the button is released.
    // button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());

    // Start the command when the button is released  and let it run the command
    // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
    // button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());
